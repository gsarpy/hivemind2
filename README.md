# Hivemind.
### Find players to team up with.
After many frustrating solo queues in Overwatch, I felt like it would be fun to build a frontend for an app that can help players find other players to team up with. I've always wished that I could put a request in Overwatch for players to join my group so we can get in sync and build some chemistry and feed off each other over a few games. It's a total crapshoot with who you will get on your team in a solo queue. Perhaps a Hanzo main that doesn't play like he's ever played Hanzo before, or maybe you want teammates that are willing to tank or play support. Whatever you're looking for, the idea of Hivemind is to focus on one unified team effort - TO WIN. 

I am building this in React, Bootstrap (might switch to materialize), and will add a NodeJS backend eventually. But for now, it's focused on the frontend development with React and React Router. 

### Current Technologies Being Used: 
* ReactJS
* Twitter Bootstrap
* JavaScript


### Future Plans:
* NodeJS Backend
* Express
* MongoDB


That's it for now. If you'd like to contribute, I'd be happy to have you. Fork the project and let's get started! I will update this ReadMe should development ever stop or pause. Thanks!
